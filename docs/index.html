      I am a pharmaceutical market analyst and strategist with expertise in forecasting, epidemiological research, and health economics and outcomes research (HEOR). My work spans commercial strategy, brand planning, and asset valuation, supporting data-driven decision-making across the pharmaceutical and biotech industries. In addition to my experience building market models and forecasting platforms, I have training in machine learning and statistical modeling, applying these methods to improve insights in drug commercialization, market access, and patient outcomes. My approach combines analytical rigor with a deep understanding of the commercial landscape to help companies optimize their strategies and navigate uncertainty.
